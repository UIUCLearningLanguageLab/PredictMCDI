# ProKWo
Why do children learn some words before others? Studying variability in word learning at an item level as well as cross-sectionally may be informative of the processes that underlie word learning. We introduce a new predictor, ProKWo (Proportion of Known Word Co-occurence), which is designed to capture childrenâ€™s existing word knowledge when predicting future word learning.

# Data Acquisition

## Mac Arthur Bates Communicative Inventories (MCDI)
We will begin by downloading all English (American) "Words & Sentences" inventories from wordbank by using the *wordbankr* package and saving the dataset in its raw form.

```{r}
# Download mcdi
get_mcdi <-
  get_instrument_data("English (American)",
                      "WS",
                      administrations = TRUE,
                      iteminfo = TRUE)

#Save file.
write.csv(get_mcdi, file = "raw_mcdi.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
